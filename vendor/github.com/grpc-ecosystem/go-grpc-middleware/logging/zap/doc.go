/*
`grpc_zap` is a gRPC logging middleware backed by ZAP loggers

It accepts a user-configured `zap.Logger` that will be used for logging completed gRPC calls. The same `zap.Logger` will
be used for logging completed gRPC calls, and be populated into the `context.Context` passed into gRPC handler code.

On calling `StreamServerInterceptor` or `UnaryServerInterceptor` this logging middleware will add gRPC call information
to the ctx so that it will be present on subsequent use of the `ctx_zap` logger.

This package also implements request and response *payload* logging, both for server-side and client-side. These will be
logged as structured `jsonbp` fields for every message received/sent (both unary and streaming). For that please use
`Payload*Interceptor` functions for that. Please note that the user-provided function that determines whetether to log
the full request/response payload needs to be written with care, this can significantly slow down gRPC.

ZAP can also be made as a backend for gRPC library internals. For that use `ReplaceGrpcLogger`.

Please see examples and tests for examples of use.
